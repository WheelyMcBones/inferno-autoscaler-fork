# Capacity-Based WVA with Parallel Overlapping Jobs
# Pattern matches HPA moderate-load experiment for direct comparison
# Jobs run in parallel with staggered start times to create cumulative load
# Tests capacity analyzer's response to overlapping workloads via KV cache and queue metrics

# Expected behavior with WVA capacity-based:
# - 0-120s: 10 req/s (KV cache builds up slowly)
# - 120-240s: 25 req/s (combined load, KV cache may trigger saturation)
# - 240-360s: 37 req/s (PEAK - maximum KV cache pressure, queue buildup expected)
# - 360-480s: 27 req/s (KV cache still high, queue may persist)
# - 480-600s: 12 req/s (KV cache drains, safe to scale down)
